There are different ways and channels that you can use as a community member or
maintainer to raise questions, collaborate or to have some fun!

## Slack

The community has a channel on the CNCF Slack called
[#tinkerbell](https://tinkerbell.org/community/slack/). Feel free to join us.
This is the perfect place to have a first point of contact with the community.
The maintainers and some contributors hang out on it. It is also the oldest
platform the Tinkerbell community has.

## GitHub issues

There are many repositories and all of them have issue enables. If you need some
help, you have questions or ideas you can open an issue against one of those
repositories. If you don't know the right components you can use
[tinkerbell/tink](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink/issues), the community will
help you to figure out the right place. Or to figure out the right repository
feel free to drop a message on Slack.

## Contributors mailing list

If you want to follow discussions about the Tinkerbell development or you want
to become a contributor there is a mailing list about that. This is not right
place for general questions related to how Tinkerbell works. The focus is 100%
on ongoing or future development.

- [Google Group: tinkerbell-contributors](https://groups.google.com/g/tinkerbell-contributors)
    - tinkerbell-contributors@googlegroups.com

We have a bi-weekly meeting to sync about ongoing work or discuss about future
development effort around the various components. You will be added to it
automatically when joining the mailing list. There is an agenda available via
[Google
Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cEObfvQ9Tdp8zIIIg9O7P5i3CKaSj2t3JTxEufDxwWs/edit#)
feel free to add your item in there before the meeting.
